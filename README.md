# QSOLenseFinder

QSOLenseFinder is a tool designed to determine whether or not QSOs (Quasi-Stellar Objects) in the DESI (Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument) survey are strong gravitational lenses. This repository contains a Python implementation of the model using Keras version 2.13.1 and NumPy version 1.24.3.

## Overview

This project includes a neural network architecture and prediction function to classify QSOs based on their spectra. The model architecture uses a series of convolutional layers followed by fully connected layers to perform binary classification.

### Dependencies

- Keras 2.13.1
- NumPy 1.24.3

### Installation

To use this project, ensure you have the required versions of Keras and NumPy installed. You can install them using pip
